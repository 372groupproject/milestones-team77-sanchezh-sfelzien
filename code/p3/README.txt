This code represents Milestone 3 of the prject. Included in this section you will find code that represents small programs used to showcase each datatype in Scala and a few of the features and quirks that come with each data type. You will find the Makefile to be up to date and will compile all programs upon invoking. Included are also just a few of the runtime errors that can occur in Scala and a small program that ties these data types altogether.
