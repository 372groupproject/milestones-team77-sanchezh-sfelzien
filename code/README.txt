Scala ~ Hector Sanchez (sanchezh@email.arizona.edu) Samantha Felzien (sfelzien@email.arizona.edu )

Included you will find the HelloWorld.scala file, which does as the name implies, prints "Hello World". Our secondary feature is based on a declared list of booleans, which are iterated through by the function and using case (switch) statements determines whether to print "heads.." or "tails...". This function highlights moreso the syntax of scala and how declarations and iterator loops are declared.
